<div align="middle"># Haskell Interpreter in Go </div>

An experimental haskell interpreter written in Go for learning purposes. The interpreter does not include complex haskell flowcharts like Monads, or other excruciatingly difficult to implement parts of haskell.

## Task List

- Token
  - [x] Common tokens
  - [ ] Complex tokens like Monad
- Lexer
  - [ ] Create tests
- Parser
  - [ ] Create tests
- AST
  - [ ] Create tests

## Why not a parser generator?

For learning purposes I have decided to refrain from using already established parsing generators like context-free grammer (CFG), with notational formats like Backus-Naur Form (BNF), or Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).
